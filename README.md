[Sambal SOS App](http://sambalsos.com/) is a social welfare platform that supports Malaysians in need by bridging the gap of social inequity. 

Hop on the [app](http://sambalsos.com/)  if:
- you see someone who needs help when driving or in your neighbourhood and want to report it so someone can help
- you're looking to support other fellow Malaysians

Built:
- By Malaysians, for Malaysians.  ðŸ‡²ðŸ‡¾
- Developed by passionate Malaysian developers, under this time of the MCO. ðŸ¥°
- Living in a lockdown may feel uncertain, but we're in this together ðŸ’ª.

## The [#benderaputih](https://twitter.com/hashtag/benderaputih) Movement
In Malaysia, the [#benderaputih](https://twitter.com/hashtag/benderaputih) movement is a social media movement urging those in urgent need of living necessities or resources to place white flags outside their homes. In this time of a pandemic, white flags placed outside homes are notices to others that they are out of food or living necessities and need help right away. 

_Cited from a [tweet](https://twitter.com/NewsBFM/status/1409734501631098881) on the [BFM News](https://twitter.com/NewsBFM/) Twitter account._

As of 2nd July 2021, the [#benderaputih](https://twitter.com/hashtag/benderaputih) movement is currently one of the largest movements in our nation, and is also trending on [Twitter](https://twitter.com) under the [#benderaputih](https://twitter.com/hashtag/benderaputih) hashtag.


## Usage
Members of our community can post a picture through this web app if they see a white flag nearby and it will be displayed on a map, so that anyone on the internet can help those in need.  Users of the app can also view the white flags posted in under a 10 KM radius of their physical location, to discover those in need who are nearby and possibly provide them with the needed resources.

We believe that our project will provide the necessary support for communities nationwide, and will benefit a lot of people in our communities, especially the underserved in tough times like these.

## About us
